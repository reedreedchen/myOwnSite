<p class="heading" id="statusTitle">Legal Status FAQ</p>
<p class="text" id="statusText">* This page is written to clarify my legal status to USA employers.</p>
 <div class="text">
<p><span class="pinkText">Q: Are you authorized to work in the United States for any companies?</span>
<br />A: Yes. I am on my first year F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT). I currently hold a valid EAD card. I am saying first year because I graduated from a STEM program and my OPT status is eligible for extension for up to 24 months.</span></p>

<p><span class="pinkText">Q: How long do you have left to transfer to H1B or permanent residency?</span>
<br />A: 2.5 years. According to <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="pinkText" onclick="window.open('http://www.nafsa.org/Professional_Resources/Browse_by_Interest/International_Students_and_Scholars/Focus_On_STEM_OPT/', 'newwindow', 'width=700, height=500'); return false;">the STEM OPT rules</a>,
"The new 24-month STEM OPT rule is effective Tuesday, May 10, 2016. All STEM OPT applications filed on and after May 10, 2016 must be accompanied by a Form I-20 bearing a 24-month STEM OPT recommendation." The program of my graduate study is on the STEM list - &#39;code 09.0702 Digital Communication and Media/Multimedia&#39; and &#39;10.0304 Animation, Interactive Technology, Video Graphics and Special Effects. My application was accepted in May 18, 2016. The expiration date of my first year OPT status is July 7, 2017 (6 months from now.) This, along with the 24-month STEM extension will give me 2.5 years to work for you and your team without any visa sponsorship.</p>
      
<p><span class="pinkText">Q: Will you need visa sponsorship in the future?</span>
<br />A: Yes. I will need sponsorship after July 2019 (2.5 years later) to work in the United States. Note that since I have a master's degree, I am eligible to transfer to Employment-Based Immigration (EB2) for permanent residency as soon as a company is willing to sponsor me. The wait-list for EB2 could be long for people from certain countries. Luckily, I am from a small island, Taiwan. The list should be small and this process might end within a few months.</p>

<p>If any other questions, please contact me by email, reedreedchen@gmail.com. I will find the answer through USCIS or an immigrant lawyer and let you know  as soon as possible.</p>
