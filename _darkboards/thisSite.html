    <p>Although this website appears to be a portfolio site, it is actually a little crafting project/hobby of mine. It has been used for many of my experiments for web development. The main layout was made back in 2013. In 2016, I made many new changes to improve user experience of this site.</p>

    <p>Dec 2016</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Made color correction.</li>
    <li>When clicking on Gallery or Animation, the viewers don't get redirected to another page thanks to jQuery.</li>
    <li>Viewers on mobile devices will see a mobile version.</li>
    <li>When closing the black table, it clears previously opened iframe src, so the viewer doesn't get confused by the old src while loading the new one.</li>
    <li>Fixed alignment issues on the popup table on mobile devices.</li>
    <li>Journal sites (external) are opened on a small  window. The journal sites are rather slow so I don't think freezing the viewers on the black table would be a good idea.</li>
    <li>The original web hosting service has been rather unstable. Therefore, I transferred this site to Google Firebase. The .php contact form has since been removed because Firebase only supports static web hosting.</li>
    <li>The domain name is trasferred to Google Domains.</li>
    <li>Added the translation function by manually translating this website and by using Javascript. Users can choose to view this site in Traditional Chinese without being redirected to another page. The variable for language control will be stored in the client's local memory to be kept consistent because Javascript does not allow static variables.</li>
    <li>Applied rounded corners.</li>
    <li>Installed loading bar.</li>
    <li>Message Board built using firebase.</li>
    </ul>

<p>May 2016</p>
<ul>
     <li>Internal pages are shown on a popup table and within iframe.</li>
 <li>Adapted image swap function.</li>     
    </ul>

<p>March 2016</p>
<ul>
     <li>I bought my new domain name: 'www.reneechenwork.com'.</li>
    </ul>
     
     
<p>2013</p>

<ul>
     <li>The main layout was built.</li></ul>
